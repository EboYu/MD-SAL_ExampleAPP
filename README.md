# MD-SAL_ExampleAPP
This repository is used to hold some MD-SAL APP of OpenDayLight which can help me learn about MD-SAL.
These app codes are from github and I did some modification.
## mdsal-rpc1
This is a simple rpc call app from [BRCDcomm/mdsalApp1](https://github.com/BRCDcomm/mdsalApp1). We can learn how to  write and compile codes by maven and install app to OpenDaylight by following the author's steps in his README.md. I just changed the position of some *.java files.
## mdsal-rpc2
This is a simple Rpc-Provider app from [md-sal](https://github.com/earthearth/odl_helium_md-sal.git). I also push the tutorial of this app. This tutorial is very detailed with comprehensive analysis of how to write codes according to our requirement. It is very useful! Thanks

Keep on learning!
